## Next Steps

1. Implement comprehensive keyboard shortcuts system
2. Add skip-to-content links for main sections
3. Conduct user testing with assistive technology users
4. Implement automated accessibility testing in the CI/CD pipeline
5. Create an accessibility statement for the admin dashboard

## Testing

To verify these improvements:

1. Test keyboard navigation throughout the interface
2. Use screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to navigate the interface
3. Use browser developer tools to check contrast and ARIA attributes
4. Run automated tests with axe-core
5. Conduct user testing with users who rely on assistive technology
