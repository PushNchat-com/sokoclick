# SokoClick Cursor Rules

This document defines the coding rules and guidelines for the SokoClick project. These rules help maintain code quality, consistency, and align with the project's design requirements.

## Rules Configuration

## Usage

These rules are enforced by Cursor AI to provide inline guidance and ensure consistent code practices throughout the SokoClick project. Rules marked as `alwaysApply: true` are enforced automatically, while others serve as contextual guidance when working with specific file types. 

## Frontend-Database Integration

When developing frontend components and services, always refer to the Supabase schema defined in `supabase/migrations/20240615120500_sokoclick_initial_schema.sql` to ensure strict alignment between frontend models and the database structure. This integration ensures data consistency, proper validation, and adherence to the business logic defined in the database schema.

## Architecture Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Clean separation between data access and business logic:
- Database operations are isolated in service methods
- Business rules are enforced at the service layer
- UI components don't directly access the database

### Hook Pattern

React hooks for data fetching and state management:
- Custom hooks encapsulate data access logic
- Components remain focused on presentation
- State management is standardized across the application

### Service Layer Pattern

Central service for all slot operations:
- All slot-related operations go through the `slotService`
- Validation and business rules are consistently applied
- Error handling is standardized

### Component Composition

Layered components from presentation to connected data:
- `SlotGrid` focuses on presentation
- `SlotGridConnected` handles data fetching
- `SlotManagement` provides complete workflow
- `StorageInitializer` manages slot storage setup

### Incremental Development

Cumulative approach to codebase modifications:
- Verify existence before creating new components/files
- Update and enhance instead of duplicating functionality
- Build coherently upon the current codebase
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing systems
- Document workarounds and edge case handling
- Implement fallback mechanisms for structural issues
- Follow established naming and formatting conventions
- Test against potential edge cases and error conditions
